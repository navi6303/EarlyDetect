# **EarlyDetect**
EarlyDetect is a web application designed for early breast cancer detection. It leverages machine learning models trained on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to predict whether a case is benign or malignant based on fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. The app provides fast, accurate predictions and offers a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, improving patient outcomes and reducing anxiety with timely diagnoses.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Breast cancer remains a critical public health issue worldwide, with early and accurate diagnosis being essential for successful treatment and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, while effective, often involve time-consuming processes and may be subject to human error.

Machine learning provides an innovative approach to enhancing breast cancer diagnosis. By leveraging medical data, such as tumor characteristics, a machine learning model can be trained to accurately predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. This technology has the potential to facilitate faster and more precise diagnoses, enabling timely medical interventions and ultimately saving lives.

A successful machine learning model could have significant business and healthcare impacts, including:

- *Improved patient outcomes*: Early detection and timely treatment can significantly boost survival rates.
- *Reduced healthcare costs*: Efficient and accurate diagnoses can streamline resource allocation and reduce unnecessary procedures.
- *Enhanced patient experience*: Quicker and more reliable diagnoses can alleviate patient anxiety and improve overall satisfaction.
- *Potential for new medical insights*: Analyzing model predictions could lead to a deeper understanding of breast cancer, potentially uncovering novel patterns and risk factors.

### OBJECTIVE
Developing a reliable machine learning model for breast cancer diagnosis can greatly enhance healthcare providers' diagnostic capabilities, leading to better patient care and advancing the field of medical research.

### ABOUT THE DATASET 
The dataset features are derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. These features capture various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images. In the 3-dimensional space, the dataset's features are described by the study:

K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian, "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets," Optimization Methods and Software, vol. 1, 1992, pp. 23-34.

    1. Attribute Information
    2. ID number

    Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
    3-32. Ten real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus:

    3. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
    4. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
    5. perimeter
    6. area
    7. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
    8. compactness (perimeterÂ² / area - 1.0)
    9. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
    10. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour
    11. symmetry
    12. fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, and field 23 is Worst Radius.

* Missing attribute values: None
* Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
